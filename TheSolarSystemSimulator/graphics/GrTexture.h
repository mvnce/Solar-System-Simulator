//! Class to load and utilize texture files in OpenGL programs.

/*! The CTexture class loads an image file into memory and allows it be
be easily used as a texture. Both regular texture mapping and Mipmapping
are supported by the model.
 
Each dimension of the texture image must be a power of two. This function
will load any image that can be loaded using the MFC function: CImage::Load().

\version 1.01 10-23-1999 Declared version number
\version 1.02 02-23-2003 Fixed bug where one constructor did not inititalize m_mipinitialized.
\version 1.03 05-02-2011 Eliminated memory leak due to failing to release textures
\version 1.04 01-14-2012 Now uses CImage from MFC to load images. Will load anything it will load.
\version 1.05 01-28-2012 Documentation updates
\version 1.06 01-30-2012 Name change from CTexture to CGrTexture for consistency
